# TicTacToe-AI
This is an implementation of the Minimax algorithm, used to create a Tic-Tac-Toe AI.

# About Minimax
Minimax is an adversarial search algorithm used to find the most optimal move at any point in the game. The algorithm evaluates the utility of a move, and returns the optimal move by recursively calling itself until it reaches all possible terminal states of the game.

# Going Further
Next steps will be implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning, a Depth-Limiter, and a randomizer that can establish different levels of AI. In this current version, the AI is undefeatable.

# How To Play
Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install pygame. Then type python runner.py into your terminal to play.
